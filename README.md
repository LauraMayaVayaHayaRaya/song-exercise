# Bohemian Rhapsody
### Queen

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody I've got to go

------- 7 --------

Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth

Mama, oh oh (anyway the wind blows)

I don't want to die

Sometimes wish I'd never been born at all
